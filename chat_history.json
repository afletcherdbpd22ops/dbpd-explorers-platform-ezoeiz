This app will include a calendar, messaging, announcement board, walkie-talkie platform, and explorer profiles.\n\nHere's the plan:\n\n**Features for the First Version:**\n\n*   **Explorer Profiles:** A dedicated profile screen (`app/(tabs)/profile.tsx`) to display rank, name, and community service hours. This will require modifications to the existing `profile.tsx` file.\n*   **Announcement Board:** A screen or component for displaying announcements. Since the user wants this to be editable, we'll need to consider how to implement the editing functionality.\n*   **Calendar:** Integrate a calendar view where all users can view and edit events.\n\n**Design Elements:**\n\n*   **Colors:**\n    *   Background: `#f0f8ff` (AliceBlue)\n    *   Text: `#2f4f4f` (DarkSlateGray)\n    *   TextSecondary: `#696969` (DimGray)\n    *   Primary: `#4682b4` (SteelBlue)\n    *   Secondary: `#b0c4de` (LightSteelBlue)\n    *   Accent: `#ffa07a` (LightSalmon)\n    *   Card: `#ffffff` (White)\n    *   Highlight: `#fffacd` (LemonChiffon)\n*   **Typography:** Use a modern, clean font like System.\n\n**Implementation Plan:**\n\n1.  **Modify `app/(tabs)/profile.tsx`:**\n    *   Add fields to display rank and community service hours. These fields will likely need to be populated with data, so consider where this data will come from (Supabase or local state).\n2.  **Create Announcement Board:**\n    *   Create a new screen or component for the announcement board.\n    *   Implement the UI for displaying announcements.\n    *   Implement editing functionality for announcements.\n3.  **Integrate Calendar:**\n    *   Add a calendar component to one of the tabs, possibly the home screen.\n    *   Allow users to view and edit events on the calendar.\n4.  **Implement Messaging and Walkie-Talkie:**\n    *   This is more complex and may require external libraries or services. For the initial version, focus on a basic messaging interface. The walkie-talkie feature can be considered for a later iteration.\n\n**Next Steps:**\n\nI will now instruct the coding agent to implement the plan. After the coding agent has implemented the plan, the modalDemos array from app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx should be removed.\n"}, {"type": "role_transition", "from_role": "planner", "to_role": "coder", "timestamp": "2025-10-04T15:16:02.457772"}, {"type": "text", "text": "I'll help you build a comprehensive platform for Daytona Beach Police Explorers.

I've successfully added \"Advisor\" to the ranks system in the Daytona Beach Police Explorers app. Here's what I implemented:\n\n## Changes Made:\n\n### 1. **Added Advisor Rank**\n- **Advisor** is now the highest rank in the system (above Explorer Major)\n- Advisors are designated as police officers overseeing the program\n- Used navy blue (#000080) color to distinguish advisors from explorer ranks\n\n### 2. **Updated Roster Screen (`app/(tabs)/roster.tsx`)**\n- Added two sample advisors: Officer Sarah Martinez and Officer Michael Rodriguez\n- Advisors have DBPD badge numbers instead of EX- prefixes\n- Added \"(Police Officer)\" notation next to Advisor rank\n- Advisors don't track community service hours (set to 0)\n- Advisors have different specializations focused on program leadership and training\n\n### 3. **Updated Profile Screen (`app/(tabs)/profile.tsx`)**\n- Updated `getRankColor()` function to include Advisor rank with navy blue color\n- Added conditional logic to hide community service hours for Advisors\n- Changed \"Join Date\" to \"Start Date\" for Advisors\n- Changed \"Specializations\" to \"Areas of Expertise\" for Advisors\n- Added \"(Police Officer)\" notation in profile display\n- Updated rank badge to show \"ADV\" for Advisors\n\n### 4. **Rank Hierarchy (from highest to lowest)**\n1. **Advisor** (Police Officers) - Navy Blue\n2. **Explorer Major** - Dark Red\n3. **Explorer Captain** - Orange Red\n4. **Explorer Lieutenant** - Blue\n5. **Explorer Sergeant** - Lime Green\n6. **Explorer Corporal** - Gold\n7. **Explorer** - Secondary Color\n\n### 5. **Key Features for Advisors**\n- Distinguished visually with navy blue color scheme\n- Clear identification as police officers\n- Different badge numbering system (DBPD vs EX)\n- Professional contact information (@daytonabeach.org emails)\n- Leadership-focused specializations\n- No community service hour tracking (as they're supervising officers)\n\nThe app now properly recognizes and displays Advisors as the police officers who oversee the Explorer program, with appropriate visual distinctions and functionality differences from the Explorer ranks."}, {"type": "lint", "status": "complete", "success": true}, {"type": "build", "build_type": "build", "status": "complete", "success": true}, {"type": "commit", "commit_id": "1919eb89816670b66caa1151479c3a37e57dea83", "message": "feat: Add Advisor rank to roster and profile screens", "timestamp": "2025-10-04T15:44:03Z", "files_changed": ["app/(tabs)/profile.tsx", "app/(tabs)/roster.tsx"], "update_number": 4, "parent_commit_id": "9dbc6e551152050ca6f15fc62c4927cec4d5c591"}], "timestamp": "2025-10-04T15:40:56Z"}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "work more to improve the walkie talkie, add more features "}]}, {"role": "assistant", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Okay, I can help you brainstorm some improvements and new features for the walkie-talkie functionality in your Daytona Beach Police Explorers app. Here's a premium design vision focusing on enhanced usability and realism:\n\n1.  **Channel Management:**\n    *   Allow users to create and manage custom channels with specific names and potentially passwords for privacy.\n    *   Implement a channel scanning feature that automatically detects available channels.\n2.  **Realistic Audio Effects:**\n    *   Incorporate simulated static and transmission noise for a more authentic walkie-talkie experience.\n    *   Add a \"roger beep\" sound at the end of transmissions.\n3.  **Proximity Detection:**\n    *   Use device location to simulate signal strength based on distance to other users on the same channel.\n    *   Implement a visual indicator of signal strength.\n4.  **Emergency Channel:**\n    *   Create a dedicated emergency channel that is always available and monitored.\n    *   Add a prominent \"panic button\" for quick access to the emergency channel.\n5.  **Voice Modulation:**\n    *   Include options for voice modulation to simulate different radio types or add anonymity.\n6.  **Push-to-Talk (PTT) Button Customization:**\n    *   Allow users to customize the size and placement of the PTT button for better ergonomics.\n    *   Add haptic feedback when the PTT button is pressed.\n7.  **Recording and Playback:**\n    *   Enable users to record and playback recent transmissions for review or documentation.\n8.  **Integration with User Roles:**\n    *   Restrict access to certain channels or features based on user rank (e.g., Advisors have access to all channels).\n9.  **Visual Enhancements:**\n    *   Improve the UI with a more realistic walkie-talkie design, including simulated buttons, knobs, and a display screen.\n    *   Add animations to indicate transmission and reception.\n"}, {"type": "role_transition", "from_role": "planner", "to_role": "coder", "timestamp": "2025-10-04T16:16:06.006675"}, {"type": "text", "text": "I'll help you improve the walkie-talkie functionality with more advanced features.
