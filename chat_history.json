This app will include a calendar, messaging, announcement board, walkie-talkie platform, and explorer profiles.\n\nHere's the plan:\n\n**Features for the First Version:**\n\n*   **Explorer Profiles:** A dedicated profile screen (`app/(tabs)/profile.tsx`) to display rank, name, and community service hours. This will require modifications to the existing `profile.tsx` file.\n*   **Announcement Board:** A screen or component for displaying announcements. Since the user wants this to be editable, we'll need to consider how to implement the editing functionality.\n*   **Calendar:** Integrate a calendar view where all users can view and edit events.\n\n**Design Elements:**\n\n*   **Colors:**\n    *   Background: `#f0f8ff` (AliceBlue)\n    *   Text: `#2f4f4f` (DarkSlateGray)\n    *   TextSecondary: `#696969` (DimGray)\n    *   Primary: `#4682b4` (SteelBlue)\n    *   Secondary: `#b0c4de` (LightSteelBlue)\n    *   Accent: `#ffa07a` (LightSalmon)\n    *   Card: `#ffffff` (White)\n    *   Highlight: `#fffacd` (LemonChiffon)\n*   **Typography:** Use a modern, clean font like System.\n\n**Implementation Plan:**\n\n1.  **Modify `app/(tabs)/profile.tsx`:**\n    *   Add fields to display rank and community service hours. These fields will likely need to be populated with data, so consider where this data will come from (Supabase or local state).\n2.  **Create Announcement Board:**\n    *   Create a new screen or component for the announcement board.\n    *   Implement the UI for displaying announcements.\n    *   Implement editing functionality for announcements.\n3.  **Integrate Calendar:**\n    *   Add a calendar component to one of the tabs, possibly the home screen.\n    *   Allow users to view and edit events on the calendar.\n4.  **Implement Messaging and Walkie-Talkie:**\n    *   This is more complex and may require external libraries or services. For the initial version, focus on a basic messaging interface. The walkie-talkie feature can be considered for a later iteration.\n\n**Next Steps:**\n\nI will now instruct the coding agent to implement the plan. After the coding agent has implemented the plan, the modalDemos array from app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx should be removed.\n"}, {"type": "role_transition", "from_role": "planner", "to_role": "coder", "timestamp": "2025-10-04T15:16:02.457772"}, {"type": "text", "text": "I'll help you build a comprehensive platform for Daytona Beach Police Explorers.
